    The Model of Henon and Heiles: Walk-Through   01
                                                  02
      The important parameter of this model is    03
   E, labelled 'energy.' It can take values bet-  04
   ween 0 and 1/6. At the start of the program,   05
   select <Run> and <Enter value for the energy>  06
   from the Menu. Start with E = 0.01. This will  07
   show non-chaotic motion.                       08
                                                  09
      A screen will now appear showing a set of   10
   axes, labelled y and y', and a closed curve.   11
   All plotted points must lie within this curve. 12
   Using the hotkeys you have the option of       13
   entering starting conditions using the mouse   14
   or the keyboard. Mostly you will find the      15
   mouse to be preferable; use the keyboard if    16
   you want to choose a point very accurately.    17
   Select <Mouse>, click on the color of your     18
   choice, click on <OK> then click on a starting 19
   point, and select <Start>. Points will appear  20
   lying on closed curves. When you have enough,  21
   select <Mouse> and choose another starting     22
   point.                                         23
                                                  24
  Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.     25

    The Model of Henon and Heiles: Walk-Through   01
                                                  02
      Build as many curves as you want. Note that 03
   if you start at around (0, 0.06), then you see 04
   a different set of curves.                     05
                                                  06
      The computer is following the solutions in  07
   three dimensions, y, y' and x. When x=0, a     08
   point is plotted. Plot a set of curves, with,  09
   say, starting point (0.06, 0). Then select     10
   <Menu> and then <Run> <See three-dimensional   11
   motion>. The default starting conditions will  12
   be those that you have just used. Select them  13
   and then <Start>. You will see a projection    14
   of the three-dimensional motion, with points   15
   plotted where x=0. The direction of viewing    16
   can be changed, using <View>, moving the       17
   sliders and then <Accept>. You will eventually 18
   see the points around the curves in the y-y'   19
   plane and a torus in the three dimensions.     20
                                                  21
      Now select a higher value for the energy:   22
   maybe E=0.3. Repeat the maps.                  23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      Increase E gradually to 0.09, noting the    03
   changes in the patterns. For E=0.09 you should 04
   be able to find a small region of chaos:       05
   points will appear to fill the region randomly.06
                                                  07
      Now increase E further, but gradually. The  08
   chaotic regions will increase in size, and the 09
   boundaries between the chaotic and non-chaotic 10
   regions will contain interesting structure     11
   such as systems of 'islands.' Any time you     12
   want, have a look at the three-dimensional     13
   motion.                                        14
                                                  15
      Eventually, chaos will reign almost every-  16
   where. But you may still be able to find small 17
   pockets of locally 'non-chaotic' behavior.     18

                                                  02
      To start, select <Model>, <Lorenz> from the 03
   Menu, and use the default values of the param- 04
   eters. Next, select <Run>, <Viewing param-     05
   eters>. You have six options of how you can    06
   view the solutions. Select each one in turn,   07
   to appreciate the variety. Next, select <Run>, 08
   <Initial conditions>. The starting values of   09
   x, y and z are not too important, since many   10
   of the solutions approach 'attractors,' reg-   11
   ardless of where the began. But you may want   12
   to experiment with different maximum times,    13
   if you feel that you are seeing too much or    14
   too little detail.                             15
                                                  16
      Now alternate between <Plot the solution>   17
   and <Viewing parameters> until you have seen   18
   all six options. Finally, select <See solution 19
   in three dimensions>. You will see a projec-   20
   tion of the three-dimensional motion in x-y-z  21
   space. Use the sliders to vary the angle of    22
   viewing, and <Redraw> to see the new view.     23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      Look at the help file under <Help>,         03
   <Lorenz maps>. Then select <Run>, <Plot Lorenz 04
   map>. You can plot points at which a coordin-  05
   ate has maxumum values; pick any of the three  06
   coordinates. In spite of the chaotic structure 07
   that you may have observed earlier, you will   08
   see points lying on a well defined locus.      09
                                                  10
      Most solutions end up on an 'attractor.'    q1
   If you only want to see this, then you can     12
   change the starting time for plotting using    13
   <Run>, <Initial conditions>. The calculation   14
   begins at time t=0; the plotting will begin    15
   at the time that you specify.                  16
                                                  17
      Most work on this model has been done with  18
   parameters s=10, b=8/3, and r varied. I sug-   19
   gest that you do the same. In particular, in-  20
   vestigate the 'windows,' in which the sol-     21
   utions are non-chaotic. See <Help>, <Lorenz's  22

                                                  03
      I recommend that, before running this mod-  04
   ule, you run the program for the simple pend-  05
   ulum, and become familiar with phase-plane     06
   diagrams. Also don't experiment at random with 07
   this model; for many ranges of the parameters  08
   there is no chaos. Start with known chaotic    09
   values and build around them.                  10
                                                  11
      Start with <Run>, <Enter parameters>, from  12
   the menu. Use numbers: f = 1, k = 0.1, w = 1.  13
   Then try <Swing the pendulum>. Experiment with 14
   different starting conditions and enjoy the    15
   amination.                                     16
                                                  17
      Next, select <Plot x versus time>. Start    18
   with the default values, but for initial cond- 19
   itions choose x = 0 and x-prime = 103. When    20
   that has been plotted, choose the hotkey       21
   <New start> and change x-prine to 103.05.      22
   Continue, increasing x-prime by small amounts. 23

   The Motion of a Periodically Forced Pendulum   01
                   Walk-through                   02
                                                  03
      You are observing one quality of chaos:     04
   sensitivity  to small changes in the starting  05
   conditions. Notice that, in most cases, the    06
   motion eventually settles down to regular      07
   oscillations, after initial transient motion.  08
                                                  09
      If the motion involves many complete circ-  10
   ulations of the pendulum it may be better to   11
   plot Sin(x) (which is always bounded) in place 12
   of x; or to plot x-prime as a function of the  13
   time. These options are available for exper-   14
   iment.                                         15
                                                  16
      Choose starting conditions that lead to as  17
   much chaos as you can manage. Now select       18
   <PhasePlot>, <See phase-plane plot> from the   19
   menu. Use all default conditions, but on the   20
   following screen enter a value IDelay = 0, so  21
   that all motion from time t = 0 is plotted.    22
                                                  23
  Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.     24

   The Motion of a Periodically Forced Pendulum   01
                   Walk-through                   02
                                                  03
      Next select <See Poincare map>. Here the    04
   curve that you saw in the phase-plane is sam-  05
   pled once during each cycle of the forcing     06
   term. You will see isolated dots which will    07
   approach a limiting dot corresponding to the   08
   limiting cycle at the finish of the transient  09
   terms. Often there is no purpose in showing    10
   the transient motion; then IDelay can be used  11
   to eliminate an initial time equal to IDelay*  12
   (the period of the forcing term). Find an      13
   appropriate value of IDelay so that in the     14
   phase-plane plot just one closed curve is      15
   shown, and only one point appears in the Poin- 16
   care map.                                      17
                                                  18
      Now repeat these steps using f = 1.2,       19
   k = 0.5 and w = 2/3. Everying remains chaotic. 20
   But the Poincare map appears to have a degree  21
   of organization.                               22
                                                  23
  Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.     24

                                                  03
      Change f to f = 1.6. Repeat the steps. Now  04
   the motion is non-chaotic (after the transient 05
   terms have gone) and periodic. The Poincare    06
   map contains just three dots.                  07
                                                  08
      Results for the last two set of parameters  09
   can be predicted from a bifurcation diagram.   10
   In this program such a diagram follows changing11
   values of f, followed on the horizontal axis.  12
   For each value, a Poincare map is found and    13
   all calculated values of x-prime are plotted   14
   on the vertical axis. So chaotic and non-      15
   chaotic regions appear clearly, and the trans- 16
   itions between the two an be observed.         17
                                                  18
      Select <See bifurcation diagram>. Use the   19
   default options to replicate figure 5.16 on    20
   page 83 of the text. You can save time, and    21
   lose some detail, by sampling fewer values of  22

      Some of the maps in this program can lead   03
   rapidly to very large numbers, causing over-   04
   flow problems and meaningless-looking results. 05
   Please consult the help files, where numerical 06
   information is provided, and, initially, make  07
   use of the default parameters. Entering num-   08
   bers more or less at randon, will only lead    09
   to frustration. Once you have a feel for the   10
   properties of the mappings you will be able to 11
   experiment. Utilities that may be especially   12
   useful are the cobweb diagram and the bifurc-  13
   ation diagram.                                 14
                                                  15
      Here we shall select the Quadratic map, and 16
   use this to walk through some of the utilities.17
                                                  18
      To start, select <Model>, <Quadratic map>   19
   from the menu. Upon selection, an input screen 20
   will appear, requesting you to enter a value   21
   for a parameter, C.                            22

      Each of the available maps contains this    03
   parameter, the variation of which will lead    04
   to different properties, chaotic and non-      05
   chaotic.                                       06
                                                  07
      The input screen includes an interval for   08
   appropriate values of C and a <Help> utility.  09
   If you click on <Help> you will see a screen   10
   giving more detailed information. For a start, 11
   put C = 0.                                     12
                                                  13
      Select <Maps>, <See cobwebs>. Use default   14
   values. You will see a screen including graphs 15
   of the functions x and f(x). Points where      16
   these intersect are solutions of x = f(x), and 17
   are called 'fixed points' of the mapping. With 18
   the hotkeys select <Seed> to enter the start-  19
   ing value of the map; enter 0.9. Then press    20
   <Next> to see the progress of the mapping: it  21
   will approach the lower of the fixed points.   22
   Repeat with 1.1 as the seed.                   23
                                                  24

      Now press <CleanUp> to clear the screen.    03
   Then follow maps with seeds -0.9 and -1.1.     04
   Experiment with others. One fixed point is     05
   'attracting' and the other is 'repelling.'     06
                                                  07
      Choose <New C>, and enter -1. Both fixed    08
   points are now repelling. Iterations can end   09
   in a 'limit cycle.' Next try C = -1.5. Try     10
   limits -2 < x < 3 for the display. Experi-     11
   ment with different seeds. Either the mapping  12
   will diverge, leaving the screen, or it will   13
   be bounded but chaotic.                        14
                                                  15
      This experiment shows some properties and   16
   characters of the mapping. A way to combine    17
   results for different values of C in some in-  18
   terval is to construct a bifurcation diagram.  19
   A single value of the seed is used. Values of  20
   C are taken on a horizontal axis. For each     21
   value of C the mapping is calculated and       22
   values are plotted on the vertical axis.       23

                                                  02
   (In practice, the first few values are not     03
   plotted, to eliminate initial transient ef-    04
   fects.) Convergence to a fixed point would     05
   result in just one point. The limit cycle      06
   that we have just seen would produce two       07
   points. Chaos would produce a scatter of       08
   points. So the diagram provides a lot of in-   09
   formation on the evolution of the mapping      10
   with changing C.                               11
                                                  12
      Select <Maps>, <See bifurcation diagram>.   13
   In the input screen look at the <Help> file,   14
   noting some recommended numbers for different  15
   maps. Note that these appear as default va-    16
   lues on the screen. You can control the number 17
   of mapped points to be ingored and the number  18
   that is then plotted. For now, accept all de-  19
   fault values, and see the diagram. Study this  20
   closely. It will give you ideas for futher     21
   experiments.                                   22

         One-Dimensional Maps: Walk-through       01
                                                  02
      The utility <Maps>, <See generating func-   03
   tion> graphs the functions x, f(x), f(f(x)),   04
   and so on. The first two show the regular      05
   fixed points. If we were just to work with     06
   the mapping g(x) = f(f(x)), then there are     07
   four fixed points, as you can see. This can    08
   help illustrate the role of bifurcation.       09
                                                  10
      The utility <Maps>, <See maps> graphs n on  11
   the horizontal axis and the nth iterate of     12
   the map on the vertical axis. For C = 0, you   13
   will see one horizontal line (after a few      14
   initial iterations) corresponding to the sta-  15
   ble fixed point. For C = -1, you wil see two   16
   lines, corresponding to the limit cycle. For   17
   C = -1.5, you will see obvious chaos.          18
                                                  19
      Let x(n+1) and x(n) be two successive it-   20
   erations. These will generate successive       21
   points with coordinates (x(0), x(1)),          22
   (x(1), x(2)), ... (x(n), x(n+1)), etc.         23

                                                  02
   The utility <Maps>, <(x(n), x(n+1))> treats    03
   these as cartesian coordinates and plots them. 04
   Select this utility; keep C = -1.5. The plot   05
   that you see appears well defined, in sharp    06
   contrast to the chaos seen in the preceding    07
   example.                                       08
                                                  09
      Next run <See histogram>, still with        10
   C = - 1.5. Accept other default parameters.    11
   The iteration has been run 10,000 times. The   12
   horizontal axis is divided into 400 intervals, 13
   and the height of the line above an interval   14
   is proportional to the number of iterates ly-  15
   ing in the interval. This shows 'preferred'    16
   values of the iteration. It can be used to     17
   interpret the streaks that appear among the    18
   chaos of a bifurcation diagram.                19
                                                  20
      In a chaotic system iterates starting       21
   close to one another separate, with the dis-   22
   tance between them increasing exponentially.   23

                                                  02
   This continues until the distance is comp-     03
   arable to the size of the system. Run the      04
   utility <See exponential separation>, still    05
   with C = - 1.5. Accept other default values    06
   of the parameters. Two iterations with         07
   slightly different seeds have been calc-       08
   ulated. What you see is the logarith of the    09
   difference between these (vertial axis) with   10
   the iterate number on the horizontal axis.     11
   While the increase is taking place, the plot   12
   of the logarith is approximately linear, show- 13
   ing that the increase is exponential. The      14
   slope of the line is related to the 'Lyapounov 15
   exponent.'                                     16
                                                  17
      The final utility, <Vary seeds> is similar  18
   to a bifurcation diagram, but C is kept fixed  19
   and the seed is gradually changed. This util-  20
   ity was included principally for use with      21
   Newton's method.                               22

                                                  02
      To run <Vary seeds> with the quadratic map, 03
   keep C = - 1.5. Take the range for the seeds   04
   to be between -1 and 1 (this can be important; 05
   if any mapping becomes large, the plotting     06
   will cease). Take the vertical range to be     07
   between -2 and 2. In this instance, the result 08
   is certainly chaotic in appearamce, but lack-  09
   ing any special features. As with the bifur-   10
   cation diagram, you can zoom in an see small   11
   regions in fuller detail.                      12
                                                  13
      Now play with other mappings. In each case, 14
   learn their basic properties before experi-    15
   menting.                                       16

      In this program you can run one of four     03
   maps that are provided, or you can make up     04
   your own. Experimenting at random will lead    05
   to frustration since mappings can easily be-   06
   come unbounded. It is safest to find para-     07
   meters that give results and then change them  08
   gradually. This walk-through will use the      09
   first of the models.                           10
                                                  11
      Select <Model>, <One> from the menu. In     12
   the input screen select <Help> and look at     13
   the help screen for general information about  14
   the model. Note that the default value of the  15
   parameter C = 1.5.                             16
                                                  17
      In the screen that follows, select <Help>   18
   from the hotkeys and examine that help screen. 19
   Then press <Input>. You have the choice of us- 20
   ing the keyboard of mouse to enter starting    21
   conditions. Use the keyboard when you need to  22
   enter precise values.                          23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      For now, use either utility. Enter, suc-    03
   cessively, (0.1, 0.1), (0.2, 0.2), (0.25,      04
   0.25) and (0.3, 0.3). In each case, press      05
   <Start> after the entry and allow time for     06
   sufficient detail to be plotted. The final     07
   run should yield chaos. Then try (0, 0.5).     08
   Experiment some more, building more detail.    09
                                                  10
      To see a smaller region in more detail,     11
   select <CleanUp>, then choose options to       12
   change the scale and to use the mouse. Then    13
   click the mouse at the LOWER LEFT-hand corner  14
   of the region, and again at the UPPER RIGHT-   15
   hand corner. Repeat the input process in       16
   this region. (You can also use the keyboard    17
   to change the scale. Make sure that you know   18
   in advance the new limits for x and y.)        19
                                                  20
      Once you have sufficiently investigated     21
   the case C = 1.5, you can decrease C to look   22
   at less chaotic cases, increase C to increase  23
   the chaos.                                     24

      Try C = 1.6, 1.7,...  Continue (maybe with  03
   smaller increments) until all patterns have    04
   disappeared.                                   05
                                                  06
      Model 2 can be investigated in the same     07
   ways. Start with the default C and then in-    08
   crease it gradually.                           09

      Models 3 and 4 are not so rewarding. 3 is   11
   related to the predator-prey model. You might  12
   vary this (changing birth or predation rates,  13
   for instance), by using the <Make your own>    14
   utility. Several of the two-species and dis-   15

Newton2D1
  Newton's Method for Two Unknowns: Walk-through  01
                                                  02
      In this program we use Newton's method to   03
   solve two equations                            04
            f(x,y) = 0   and   g(x,y) = 0.        05
   The process generates a sequence of pairs,     06
   (x,y) which may converge to a solution or may  07
   not converge. If the equations have several    08
   solutions, then the initial point of the iter- 09
   ation will decide whether the sequence con-    10
   verges, and, if it does converge, which of the 11
   solutions will be reached.                     12
                                                  13
      There are three systems of equations to     14
   choose from, or you can make up your own.      15
                                                  16
      Enter <Model>, <One> in the menu to select  17
   the first. Use the default values on the input 18
   screen. Then enter <Run>, <Follow iterations>. 19
   You have the option of selecting starting con- 20
   ditions using the mouse or keyboard; the mouse 21
   is simpler, unless you want precise values.    22
                                                  23
  Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.     24

                                                  02
      The four solutions to the equations are     03
  marked by crosses.                              04
                                                  05
      Press <Mouse> and click on a starting point.06
   Points for successive iterations will be plot- 07
   ted. Usually these will converge quickly. The  08
   plotting will stop, anyway, after 20 iter-     09
   ations. (If you become impatient, press a key.)10
   As you select different starting points, it can11
   become a game to guess which solution will be  12
   chosen.                                        13
                                                  14
      This randomness is used in the utilities    15
   for generating fractal patterns. Select <See   16
   fractal patterns. 1>. A picture will be drawn  17
   in which each pixel (or group of pixels) is    18
   colored according to the solution chosen, or,  19
   if there is no convergence, not colored, but   20
   left black.                                    21
                                                  22

      Now you can observe the 'fractal' nature    03
   of the diagram. Mentally, pick a small region  04
   that you want to investigate. This should con- 05
   tain some chaotic appearing graphics. Using    06
   the mouse, click on the lower left corner and  07
   then the upper right corner of the region. You 08
   will see patterns similar in nature to what you09
   observed before. Continue zooming in, in this  10
   way.                                           11
                                                  12
      Next, select <See fractal patterns. 2>.     13
   Points on the diagram are now colorewd ac-     14
   cording to the number of iterations before     15
   convergence, without regard to the solution    16
   that was chosen. This provides a more colorful 17
   picture. Again, you can zoom in and see the    18
   continuation of the patterns in smaller and    19
   smaller regions.                               20
                                                  21

                                                  02
      Select <Model>, <Volterra> from the menu.   03
   Accept the default values. You can choose to   04
   enter starting conditions using the keyboard   05
   or the mouse. Probably you will find the       06
   mouse to be more convenient.                   07
                                                  08
      Next, select <Run>, <Predator-prey plot>.   09
   This utility will generate plots with the      10
   prey population on the horizontal, and the     11
   predator population on the vertical axis.      12
   This model has an equilibrium (i.e., values    13
   of the populations that remain constant) and   14
   this is marked by a small circle on the screen.15
   For the default values the equilibirium is at  16
   (1, 1). Bear in mind that, for numerical work, 17
   the populations will be scaled. The number 1   18
   might, for instance, designate an actual pop-  19
   ulation of one million.                        20
                                                  21
      For a start, select a starting point close  22
   to the equilibrium. Follow the solution until  23
   you see a complete cycle.                      24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25

                                                  02
      Now look at solutions starting further from 03
   the equilibrium. As the range of variation in- 04
   creases, the populations can temporarily be-   05
   come very small; but a feature of this model is06
   that neither species evercompletely dies out.  07
                                                  08
      The predator-prey plane is useful for view- 09
   ing many solutions together. To appreciate the 10
   dependence on the time, select <Time plots>.   11
   Look at a solution starting close to the equ-  12
   ilibrium and then one starting further away,   13
   noting the sharp peaks for the larger cycles.  14
                                                  15
      The utility <Three-D plots> enables you to  16
   see the two populations and the time plotted   17
   together.                                      18
                                                  19
      For many species the birthrate of the prey  20
   varies cyclically, perhaps with the seasons.   21
   To investigate this select <Model>, <Cyclical  22
   growth rate>.                                  23
                                                  24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25

                                                  02
      The birthrate for the prey is given by      03
   an expression                                  04
              (A0 + A1*Sin(p*t))x,                05
   where x is the prey population and t is the    06
   time. You can enter numbers for A0, A1 and     07
   the frequency p. (Remember that the period of  08
   change is P = (2.Pi)/(frequency).) For a       09
   start, take A0 = 1, A1 = 0.2 and p = 1. Select 10
   <Predator-prey plot>. You will be given the    11
   choice: 'See continuous curve' or 'See Poin-   12
   care map.' Choose the first, and pick a start- 13
   ing point close to (1, 2). You will see little 14
   apparent organization. (Note that the <Cleanup>15
   option allows you to start a new solution or to16
   remove the current mess and continue the cur-  17
   rent solution.                                 18
                                                  19
      Now select <Time plots>. Select a value 60  20
   for the length of time and (1, 2) for the      21
   start. Now a degree of organization is much    22
   clearer.                                       23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      A better way to view results in the pred-   03
   ator-prey plane is to plot isolated points at  04
   intervals of the period P of the growth rate   05
   cycle. The form a 'Poincare map.' Accordingly, 06
   select <Predator-prey plot> and then select    07
   <See Poincare maps>. Pick a starting point     08
   close to (1, 2). You will see a system of      09
   'islands.' Now experiment with different       10
   starting points and look for different sorts   11
   of structure and for chaos.                    12
                                                  13
      To see how chaos can vary, change the par-  14
   ameter A1 in the input screen for cyclical     15
   growth. If you increase it, the onset of       16
   chaos will be more rapid.                      17
                                                  18

      With the many different options and para    03
   meters in this program it is best to develop   04
   it gradually.                                  05
                                                  06
      To start select <Parameters>, <Enter op-    07
   tions> from the menu. Make sure that none of   08
   the options is selected and press OK. Use the  09
   default values for the infection and cure      10
   rates. Now select <Display>, <Graph par-       11
   ameters>, again accepting the default values.  12
   You will see a graph of the numbers suscep-    13
   tible, the numbers infected and the numbers    14
   'removed' (either dead or cured).              15
                                                  16
      Experiment with changing the values of the  17
   infection and cure rates, and see what effects 18
   this may have on the progress of the disease.  19
   If you select <Phase-plane S-I plots > then    20
   you will see a graph with S horizontal and I   21
   vertical.                                      22
                                                  23

      Next, using <Parameters>, <Enter options>,  03
   select vaccination. In the input screen for    04
   the vaccination parameters, select c = 1.      05
   Then investigate the cases k = 0, 1, 2 in      06
   turn. Compare results with no vaccination.     07
                                                  08
      Next, select incubation only. In the incub- 09
   ation input screen, start with d = 10. This    10
   results in a figure that is almost the same    11
   as that for no incubation. But repeat with     12
   b = 5, 2, 1, 0.2. Notice the degree to which   13
   the rate of progress of the disease is slowed. 14
                                                  15
      Next, include vaccination and incubation.   16
                                                  17
      If the disease is to be followed over a     18
   long period of time, birth and death need to   19
   be included. In <Enter options> select ONLY    20
   <Birth and death>. The birth and death rates   21
   can vary for those susceptible, infected or    22
   removed. Use the default values:               23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      Susceptibles: birth, 3; death, 2.4.         03
      Infectives:   birth, 0; death, 3.           04
      Immune:       birth, 0; death, 1.           05
                                                  06
      Now use <Time plots>, with the time exten-  07
   ded to t = 10. You will observe a periodic     08
   behavior in the spread of the disease. If you  09
   use the S-I plots, you will see a family of    10
   closed curves.                                 11
                                                  12
      Finally, include a periodic rate of infec-  13
   tion. Use the formula: 1 + 0.2*Sin(t); then    14
   in the 'infection' input screen a0 = 1,        15
   a1 = 0.2 and p = 1. Go to the S-I display.     16
   Use a horizontal range of 1 to 10 and a vert-  17
   ical range of 0 to 3. Select Poincare maps.    18
   Use the mouse for starting conditions. You     19
   will see both non-chaotic and chaotic          20
   structure.                                     21

Malaria1
        The Spread of Malaria: Walk-through       01
                                                  02
      This is a program having a lot of par-      03
   ameters. Random experimentation will only      04
   lead to results that cannot be interpreted.    05
                                                  06
      For a start, I suggest that you have mos-   07
   quitos that do not spread malaria, so that the 08
   two species do not interact -- any bites will  09
   be harmless. However, start with some who are  10
   infected, so that you can invetigate recovery  11
   rates.                                         12
                                                  13
      Select <Parameters>, <Parameters for the    14
   model> from the menu. In the first input       15
   screen you will see a column for humans, on    16
   the left, and a column for mosquitos. Not all  17
   those infected will also be infectious. To     18
   start with, the proportion of those who are    19
   infectious will be zero; so enter 0 in each    20
   case.                                          21
                                                  22
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    23
                                                  24
                                                  25

                                                  02
      In the model the recovery and death rates   03
   are proportional to the numbers infected. For  04
   recovery rates, try 0.1 and 1, and for death   05
   rates, 1 and 0.1. (Humans have better doc-     06
   tors!) The parameters controlling the rate at  07
   which mosquitos bite is important; for the     08
   present, enter 0.                              09
                                                  10
      The natural growth of the human population, 11
   Ph, is logistic:                               12
            d(Ph)/dt = a0*Ph*(Pm - Ph),           13
   where Pm is the maximum sustainable population 14
   and a0 is a constant that you must enter. I    15
   suggest a0 = 0.01. If the time, t, is meas-    16
   ured in years, this allows reasonable growth   17
   in a period of ten years.                      18
                                                  19
      The second input screen is concerned with   20
   the growth rate of the mosquitos. This is log- 21
   istic, but the parameters corresponding to     22
   a0 and Pm, above, can vary cyclically.         23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      For now, avoid cyclical changes. Enter      03
   B0 = 1, (mosqitos propagate more rapidly than  04
   humans) and B1 = 0. Then M0 = 50, M1 = 0.      05
   For the phase constants, B2 = M2 = 0. For the  06
   period of variation leave P = 1.               07
                                                  08
      In the third input screen, enter the max-   09
   imum sustainable human population, Pm, to be   10
   50, the initial populations to be 20, each,    11
   and the initial numbers infected to be 10      12
   each. Finally, enter 10 as the time span for   13
   the plots.                                     14
                                                  15
      You will see that the mosquitos reach their 16
   maximum population very rapidly. You may want  17
   to experiment with the growth parameters to    18
   very this.                                     19
                                                  20
      Now its time for malaria. For the prop-     21
   ortions of those infected that are infectious, 22
   enter 1 and 1. For the bite rate enter 1.      23
                                                  24

                                                  02
   Keep other parameters the same. Next enter 2   03
   for the bite rate, and note the significant    04
   change. Now experiment with quantities such as 05
   the death and cure rates.                      06
                                                  07
      To experiment with cyclical variation,      08
   first try B1 nonzero. B1 can be larger than    09
   B0, so that at times the natural growth is     10
   negative; but be careful here. Then take M1    11
   to be nonzero.                                 12
                                                  13
      Continue experimenting; but it is best to   14
   change one parameter at a time, and to do so   15
   gradually.                                     16
                                                  17

                  Walk-through                    02
                                                  03
      To start select <Run>, <Follow contraction  04
   to systole> from the menu. You will see an S-  05
   shaped curve on the screen. Learning the role  06
   of this curve will help in the understanding   07
   of the model. The horizontal axis, b, repres-  08
   ents electrochemical activity. The vertical    09
   axis, x, represents heart muscle fiber length. 10
   The parameter for the model is T, which re-    11
   presents the overall tension.                  12
                                                  13
      In one half of the cycle of a heartbeat     14
   there is a contraction of the muscles to push  15
   blood into the ventricles and then down the    16
   arteries. The fully contracted state is called 17
   systole. The position of this state in the     18
   figure is the star lying on the curve to the   19
   right.                                         20
                                                  21
      Select the hotkey <Tension>. Then move the  22
   sliders to vary the tension and the position   23
   of systole.                                    24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25

                  Walk-through                    02
                                                  03
      Experiment with different values. Then      04
   press <Solution>, select the mouse, and then   05
   click at some point to select a starting pos-  06
   ition. The path to systole will be plotted.    07
   The plotting will become slow, since the path  08
   is approaching an equilibrium. Stop the plot-  09
   ting by pressing <Stop> and then enter another 10
   starting point. You will notice that paths are 11
   attracted toward the ends of the S-shaped      12
   curve but are repelled from points in the mid- 13
   dle.                                           14
                                                  15
      When you have several paths, press <DField> 16
   to see a direction field diagram in which the  17
   arrows point along the directions of the       18
   curves.                                        19
                                                  20
      Experiment further with different values    21
   of the tension and different positions of the  22
   systole.                                       23
                                                  24

                  Walk-through                    02
                                                  03
      Now select <Run>, <See complete cycles>.    04
   Follow the prompts to select a value for the   05
   tension and then to locate the systole and     06
   diastole positions. (I strongly advise using   07
   the mouse. The points must lie on the S-shaped 08
   curve.) You will see the complete cycle.       09
   Plotting will slow down close to the equi-     10
   librium points because of the computations,    11
   not because of any physical cause.             12
                                                  13
      If you press <Tension> during the plotting, 14
   then you can select a new value for the ten-   15
   sion, and the cycle is started without need    16
   for reselecting systole of diastole. Press     17
   <Input> for a complete reselection.            18
                                                  19
      If the S-shaped curve bulges further to     20
   the right than the systole, then the cycle     21
   cannot be completed and there is a heart       22
   attack                                         23
                                                  24

                                                  03
      Finally, select <Run>, <Plot and EKG>.      04
   The selection of tension, systole and dia-     05
   stole is similar to that just used. Now you    06
   will see the cycle, as before, but also a plot 07
   of b, the electrochemical activity as a fun-   08
   ction of the time, the equivalent of an EKG.   09

                                                  02
      To start, select <Run>, <Enter parameters>  03
   from the menu. You will be prompted to enter   04
   values for the drag and lift coefficients.     05
   Accept the default values. You might change    06
   them if, for instance, you wanted to follow    07
   the motion of a softball.  You can also select 08
   a regular pitch or a knuckleball. Select the   09
   regular pitch.                                 10
                                                  11
      The following screen (which you can access  12
   also by <Select display>) allows you to choose 13
   which projections of the motion you want to    14
   see. Read the definitions of the axes. For     15
   now, select to see only the x-z plane.         16
                                                  17
      The next screen (directly accessed through  18
   <See pitches>) prompts for initial conditions. 19
   First, have no spin, vx = 125, vy = 0 and      20
   vz = -5ft/sec. Pitch from a height of 6 ft.    21
   Press the hotkey <Pitch> to see the motion.    22
                                                  23

                                                  02
      Now press <NewPitch>. To see the effect     03
   of topspin, enter 100 rad/sec for wy. Leave    04
   other parameters the same. Repeat with back-   05
   spin, wy = -100.                               06
                                                  07
      Next change the display so that you see     08
   all three projections. Add a spin component    09
   wz = 200. Use <NewPitch> to modify the start-  10
   ing conditions so that the pitch will finish   11
   on the x-axis; you will need to introduce an   12
   initial y-component of velocity, vy.           13
                                                  14
      Once again, select <Enter parameters>.      15
   This time select <KnuckleBall>. Select all     16
   three views. The ball should rotate slowly,    17
   and should be pitched at a moderate speed.     18
   Choose 4 rad/sec for the rotation, and init-   19
   ial deflection 1.5 rad. Start with vx = 100,   20
   vy = 0, vz = 5 ft/sec. Observe the pitch.      21
   Then change the pitch parameters, one at a     22
   time to follow their effects.                  23
                                                  24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25

                                                  02
      The forces of drag and lift are crucial     03
   for the motion of a driven golf ball. Start    04
   by selecting <Run>, <See Demonstration>. The   05
   object is to show motion (a) without drag or   06
   lift (so gravity is the only force), (b) drag  07
   but no lift, and (c) drag and lift. Use the    08
   default values of the drag and lift coeffic-   09
   ients. First, use values: velocity, 200 ft/sec 10
   making 10 deg with the horizontal, backspin    11
   wy = - 300 rad/sec.                            12
                                                  13
      Notice how drag diminishes the range, but   14
   backspin increases it. Also notice the shape   15
   of the final drive; rising in almost a         16
   straight line, with the backspin countering    17
   the force of gravity, and falling abruptly,    18
   with the velocity reduced by drag.             19
                                                  20
      Repeat the demonstration with backspin      21
   wy = - 400 rad/sec.                            22
                                                  23
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    24

                                                  02
      Now use <Select display> to see all three   03
   views of the motion, and select <See drives>.  04
   Use the conditions from the demonstration,     05
   but now introduce sidespin, with, for in-      06
   stance, wz = 100 rad/sec.                      07
                                                  08
      It can be entertaining to change the par-   09
   ameters for lift and drag. If you increase     10
   the parameter for the lift by a factor of      11
   ten, you may be surprised at the resulting     12
   motion. It would also cause comment on a       13
   golf course.                                   14

      The items under <Run> in the menu consist   03
   of: <Enter parameters>, where you can enter    04
   values for the drag and lift coefficients;     05
   <Bounce parameters>, where you can enter the   06
   parameter controlling the height of a bounce   07
   and the extent to which spin will influence    08
   its direction; <Select display>, where you     09
   can choose any or all of three views for ob-   10
   serving the motion; <See serves>, for entering 11
   starting conditions and actually serving.      12
                                                  13
      If you start with <Run>, <Enter parameters>,14
   then the remaining prompts will automatically  15
   follow. Do this. Accept default values; but in 16
   designing the actual serve, you can make your  17
   own values. Start with no spin. Pick a height  18
   and location for the serve, a speed and a hor- 19
   izontal direction. Then vary the angle that    20
   the serve makes with the vertical.             21
                                                  22

                                                  02
      If you pick all the default values, you     03
   should see a serve that clears the net easily  04
   and just lands in court. That serve started    05
   with velocity making - 1 deg with the horiz-   06
   ontal. Reduce this starting angle until the    07
   serve just clears the net. The difference bet- 08
   ween the two angles shows the narrow margin of 09
   error available to the server. Design your own 10
   serve and find the corresponding margin. Find  11
   the effects on this margin when the speed of   12
   the serve is increased.                        13
                                                  14
      Now introduce topspin, wy = 50 rad/sec,     15
   say. This should increase the margin of error. 16
                                                  17
      Also investigate the effects of spin on     18
   bounce of the ball. Experiment with the bounce 19
   parameters and the speed of the serve, as well 20
   as the spin.                                   21

      Under the menu item <Run>, <Enter Param-    03
   eters> enables you to enter perameters for     04
   drag and lift; you can also select a bowl      05
   with its trajectory and bounce dominated by    06
   spin, or a 'swinging' bowl where there is      07
   no spin. <Bounce parameters> enables you to    08
   control the height of the bounce and the ex-   09
   tent to which the spinning ball 'grips' the    10
   ground. <Select display> enables you to sel-   11
   ect any or all of three views for seeing the   12
   motion. <See bowls> enables you to enter the   13
   starting conditions, and to see the motion.    14
                                                  15
      To start, select <Run>, <Enter parameters>  16
   from the menu. Select <Regular> for the bowl.  17
   Use default values for the first three input   18
   screens. For the starting conditions take      19
   vx = 60, vy = vz = 0 ft/sec; wx = -50, wy = wz 20
   = 0 rad/sec. Initial height 8 ft. This is a    21
   slow ball with the spin causing a deviation in 22
   the direction at the bounce.                   23
                                                  24

                                                  02
       You will probably find it best to select   03
   <HideBall> with the hotkeys. In the display    04
   the yellow line is the wicket. This is a tar-  05
   get for the bowler.                            06
                                                  07
      Now press <NewBall> and change vy to        08
   -1 ft/sec. Note the result. Experiment by      09
   changing input numbers one by one. For, in-    10
   stance, try the initial vz = 5 ft/sec. In-     11
   crease the starting speed.                     12
                                                  13
      A fast ball might have vx = 120 ft/sec, or  14
   higher. If this has an initial negative value  15
   of vz, then the bounce may occur early and     16
   the ball may rise to imperil the batsman;      17
   this is a 'bouncer.' Spin is not important     18
   here; the key is intimidation!                 19
                                                  20
      Now in <Enter Parameters> select <Swing>.   21
   There is no spin, but a sideways force re-     22
   sults from an asymmetric orientation of the    23
                                                  24

                                                  03
      The program opens with an input screen for  04
   the starting conditions. Choose the default    05
   values, with the hit at height 8 ft, -15 ft    06
   from the net, with speed 100 ft/sec making     07
   the angle 20 degrees with the horizontal.      08
   Note the extreme effects of drag on the traj-  09
   ectory.                                        10
                                                  11
      Now change the initial angle from 20 to 30  12
   degrees and notice that the range is hardly    13
   affected.                                      14
                                                  15
      Repeat, starting at a height of 6 ft.       16
                                                  17
      Use this as a basis for experimentation.    18
   You can execute a variety of different shots,  19

                                                  02
      One of the interesting features of this     03
   model is that the range of a discus can be     04
   increased if it is thrown into the wind. To    05
   confirm this, start by selecting <Run>,        06
   <Enter parameters> from the menu. Accept       07
   the default values with the exception of the   08
   wind speed: enter 20 m/sec. Then select        09
   <Throw the discus> and see the trajectory      10
   noting the range. Next press the hotkey        11
   <Input>. Change the  wind speed to 10. Fin-    12
   ally, repeat with wind speed zero. (You must   13
   start with the greatest range in order to      14
   have all trajectories fully visible.)          15
                                                  16
      Now vary other parameters. Experiment with  17
   different angles for the throw. What might     18
   you do to maximize range if the wind is be-    19
   hind you?                                      20

      Select <Run>, <Enter parameters> from the   03
   menu to enter the starting conditions for a    04
   throw. For a start, use the default values.    05
   Look at the trajectory.                        06
                                                  07
      Next, press the hotkey <Input> and experi-  08
   ment with the starting conditions, changing    09
   them by small amounts, one at a time. In part- 10
   icular, find the effect of the starting angle  11
   on the range.                                  12
                                                  13
      The parameter concerning the javelin itself 14
   is the distance of the center of pressure from 15
   the center of mass. Look at the effects of     16
   small changes in this quantity.                17

                                                  02
      The menu item <Run>, <Starting conditions>  03
   prompts you to enter the conditions for launch 04
   from a parking orbit around the Earth. <See    05
   the animation> shows the animated orbital mot- 06
   ion. The second usually follows automatically  07
   after the entry of the starting conditions.    08
                                                  09
      In the starting screen note the interpret-  10
   ation of the start. Accept all the default     11
   values and then see the motion: it should re-  12
   sult in a direct hit on the Moon. Become fam-  13
   iliar with the options  for marking the pos-   14
   itions in the orbits of the spacecraft and     15
   the Moon.                                      16
                                                  17
      Make the position at launch from the par-   18
   king orbit the parameter to vary. Initially it 19
   is -40 deg. Try - 39 deg. You should miss the  20
   Moon and return to the Earth. Next try -41,    21
   -42 and then -43 deg. Ultimately, you should   22
   escape from the Earth-Moon system.             23

                                                  02
      If you start with conditions chosen at      03
   random, you are very unlikely to approach      04
   anywhere near to the Moon. So change things    05
   gradually. Experiment with changes in the      06
   speed at launch, or the size of the parking    07
   orbit.                                         08
                                                  09
      You will find situations when the orbit of  10
   the spacecraft undergoes big changes before,   11
   maybe, hitting the Moon. Note that you can     12
   change the scale to enable you to follow mo-   13
   tion of this sort.                             14

      The model is very sensitive to the start-   03
   ing conditions. You may find yourself circ-    04
   ling the Earth endlessly without apparent      05
   change in the shape of the path, or you may    06
   crash at once. Try to find situations where    07
   you have six to ten revolutions before land-   08
   ing.                                           09
                                                  10
      The menu item <Run>, <Paraneters and init-  11
   ial conditions> is used for starting any       12
   orbit. It is simplest to start, as suggested,  13
   on the x-axis, moving perpendicular to the     14
   x-axis; then just two numbers are needed for   15
   the initial conditions. Take the default value 16
   for x, and put vy = 7.85. Keep all other def-  17
   ault values, but note the interpretations.     18
                                                  19
      Before starting the animation, press the    20
   hotkey <Notrail> so that <Trail> appears. Then 21
   press <Run>. You should see several revolut-   22
   ions before landing.                           23
                                                  24

SkyLab2
        The Descent of Skylab: Walk-through       01
                                                  02
      Look at the way the orbit changed. The      03
   closest point (perigee) remained about the     04
   same distance from the Earth, but the furthest 05
   point (apogee) approached the Earth. Most of   06
   the drag is near perigee, where the atmos-     07
   pheric density is greatest. Eventually, the    08
   orbit is nearly circular, drag is strong all   09
   the way around, and the decay is rapid.        10
                                                  11
      Another way to see this effect is to plot   12
   the altitude (the distance from the surface    13
   of the Earth) as a function of the time.       14
                                                  15
      Now diminish the intitial vy by small am-   16
   ounts until skylab has just one revolution     17
   before landing. Then increase it to see many   18
   revolutions.                                   19
                                                  20
      Try starting with smaller initial altitude  21
   (so the initial drag is much greater).         22
                                                  23
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    24

                                                  02
      You can vary three quantities: the cross-   03
   sectional area and the mass of Skylab and the  04
   value of the drag coefficient. The actual      05
   effect of drag on the acceleration is pro-     06
   portional to                                   07
                                                  08
           (drag coefficient)*(Area)/Mass         09
                                                  10
   so you can effectively changed the drag by     11
   altering just one of these three quantities.   12
                                                  13

                                                  02
      Select <Run>, <Parameters> from the Menu.   03
   Note the choices. These include the altitude   04
   of launch and a factor for exaggerating the    05
   scale of the latitude. Also take note of the   06
   geometry of launch that is shown to the left.  07
   Keep the default values for now.               08
                                                  09
      On the main graph you will see sliders that 10
   can be used to vary the speed at launch and    11
   the launch angle. With the default values,     12
   press <Fire>. Now press <Aim> and change only  13
   the angle; try to maximize the range.          14
                                                  15
      Change the launch speed. Again find the     16
   angle that maximizes the range.                17
                                                  18
      In experiments, vary the launch height and  19
   the cross-sectional area and mass of the ICBM. 20
   Increasing these will diminish (mass) or in-   21
   crease (area) the drag on the ICBM.            22
                                                  23

                                                  02
      Select <Run>, <Parameters for Jupiter> from 03
   the menu. These are set for the actual values. 04
   Later, you may find it interesting to vary     05
   them. (You might pick values for Saturn, for   06
   instance.)                                     07
                                                  08
      <Initial conditions for the comet> enables  09
   you to start the motion. Study the geometry    10
   and the definitions of the units. The initial  11
   default value of the speed is that that IF you 12
   accept the default values, the closest dis-    13
   tance of the comet from the Sun in the initial 14
   revolution will equal the radius of Jupiter's  15
   orbit. If you change the initial distance, and 16
   still want the same closest distance, use the  17
   button to make that selection. For now, keep   18
   the default values, but take the speed to be   19
   0.0308 units.                                  20
                                                  21

                                                  02
      In the graphics screen press the hotkey     03
   <Run>. (You may want to slow down the anim-    04
   ation.) The comet will be 'captured' into a    05
   much smaller orbit, with aphelion distance     06
   (the furthest distance from the Sun) close     07
   to the radius of Jupiter's orbit. Any close    08
   encounter between Jupiter and the comet is     09
   shown in a window to the right.                10
                                                  11
      I recommend that you let the motion keep    12
   running. There are many further close encoun-  13
   ters, and many changes in the shape of the     14
   orbit. If part of the orbit leaves the screen, 15
   use the <Rescale> option, and choose to con-   16
   tinue the present orbit.                       17
                                                  18
      Next, return to the menu and the input      19
   screen for initial conditions. Change the      20
   starting angle of Jupiter to 186 deg. This     21
   will result is the immediate expulsion of the  22
   comet from the solar system.                   23
                                                  24

L41
          Motion Close to L4: Walk-through        01
                                                  02
      It is easy in the program to produce non-   03
   sense and to get lost, especially when dealing 04
   with Poincare maps. For a start, avoid these.  05
                                                  06
      It is convenient to have names for the two  07
   attracting bodies; they are called the Earth   08
   and Moon, although the mass parameter need not 09
   apply to them. This parameter is:              10
                                                  11
      (Mass of Moon)/(Sum of the two masses).     12
                                                  13
   The input screen for this will appear when the 14
   program starts; it can also be accessed by     15
   selecting <Run>, <Enter mass parameter> from   16
   the menu. Choose the default value 0.01.       17
                                                  18
      You will need to get used to the units of   19
   the model. The constant distance between the   20
   Earth and the Moon is one unit of length. The  21
   period of the Moon's orbit around the Earth is 22
   2*Pi units of time.                            23
                                                  24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25


L42
          Motion Close to L4: Walk-through        01
                                                  02
      There are two ways to view the orbit of the 03
   third body. In a fixed reference system we see 04
   the Earth at the center, the Moon, M, moving   05
   around  the Earth, the point L4 (one unit of   06
   length from the Earth and the Moon) also mov-  07
   ing around the Earth, and, finally, the third  08
   body, hopefully, moving around L4. Let's view  09
   this first.                                    10
                                                  11
      Select <See orbits with fixed axes>. You    12
   are prompted for initial conditions relative   13
   to L4. Use the default values: (0.02, 0) and   14
   (0, 0).                                        15
                                                  16
      The resulting animation can be confusing    17
   when it is the motion relative to L4 which is  18
   of concern. The other option is to view motion 19
   from a rotating reference system in which the  20
   Earth, the Moon and L4 are all fixed. Select   21
   <See orbits with rotating axes>. Now the mo-   22
   tion appears more simply.                      23
                                                  24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25

                                                  02
      Now repeat, changing only the initial value 03
   of the dx, the x-displacement from L4. 0.01    04
   and 0.02 result in motion that remains close   05
   to L4; 0.03 results in escape. Try 0.025,      06
   0.026,... You should find that the borderline  07
   between bounded motion and escape is between   08
   0.028 and 0.029.                               09
                                                  10
      Repeat the experiment using different val-  11
   ues of the mass parameter. Some special values 12
   are given on the input screen. Confirm the     13
   properties of these values, as stated.         14
                                                  15
      Now prepare to see some Poincare maps. Take 16
   0.01 for the mass parameter and see the orbit  17
   with start (0.01, 0), (0,0). You will see at   18
   the top of the screen the statement:           19
                                                  20
    Energy for these conditions: C = 3.0000759.   21
                                                  22
   C is a constant for this orbit.                23
                                                  24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25

                                                  02
      The Poincare maps are to compute different  03
   oribts having this same value. Select <See     04
   Poincare maps>. Accept the value of C. Choose  05
   to see the orbits in addition to the maps.     06
   Choose to enter initial conditions from the    07
   keyboard. The first orbit should have the      08
   same conditions used just before. Let this     09
   run until you are seeing a definite pattern.   10
                                                  11
      Press <NewMap>. Replace dx = 0.01 by        12
   dx = 0.011. Continue, gradually increasing     13
   dx until the orbit becomes unbounded. If the   14

      For a Poincare map C is given, and initial  18
   conditions dx, vx are input. Initially dy = 0  19
   and vy is found, consistent with the value of  20
   C. Motion is followed in the three dimension-  21
   al space dx - dy - vx. Whenever dy = 0, the    22
   point (dx, vx) is plotted in the dx - vx plane.23

                                                  02
      Continuing the experiment, see the map      03
   with starting conditions (0.014, 0). Note the  04
   shape built up by the points. Now select       05
   <See Poincare maps in 3-D>. Accept default     06
   values, which will refer to the computation    07
   just made. You will see the motion in three    08
   dimensions, with points marked where the       09
   orbit crosses the x - vx plane. In three       10
   dimensions the orbit lies on a torus. This     11
   can be hard to view. Try changing the direc-   12
   tion of viewing so that you can see the hole   13
   in the torus.                                  14

      The parameters of the model are those that  03
   define the target planet and its atmosphere,   04
   and the incoming spacecraft. For a start, ac-  05
   cept the default values for these and for the  06
   initial conditions. The graphics screen will   07
   show a non-circular planet; this is due to the 08
   scale. See the orbit, which will result in     09
   atmospheric braking. Press <CleanUp> and       10
   change the minimum value of y to -100000.      11
   Try again!                                     12

      Small changes in the starting conditions    14
   make a big difference. So it is best to use    15
   the keyboard for experimenting. Find ranges    16
   of values for the start that will lead to cap- 17
   ture.                                          18
                                                  19
      Change parameters one at a time. For ins-   20
   tance, you might start by varying the planet-  21
   ary atmosphere.                                22

      The menu item <Data>, <Enter parameters>    03
   will appear automatically at the start of the  04
   program. To start, accept the default input,   05
   so that there will be no friction.             06
                                                  07
      Next select <Animate>, <Swing the pend-     08

   to choose initial conditions, and observe the  10
   animation. Then select <Time plots> to see     11
   the angular displacement and angular velo-     12

                                                  14
      Finally, select <Phase-plane>, in which     15
   the axes are angular displacement (horizontal) 16
   and angular velocity (vertical). Accept the    17
   default quantities on the input screen. Use    18
   the mouse to choose initial conditions, and    19
   follow the animation to interpret the closed   20

      Note that the phase-plane axes are set so   03
   that circulatory motion (which would normally  04
   continue indefinitely in the horizontal sense) 05
   leaves the screen, but is then continued from  06
   the opposite end.                              07
                                                  08
      Now return to <Data>, <Enter parameters>    09
   and enter a small number, say, 0.1, for the    10
   friction parameter, choosing regular friction. 11
   Repeat observations, using each of the three   12
   utilities. Then increase the friction par-     13
   ameter.                                        14
                                                  15
      Finally, select dry friction, and see if    16
   that differs significantly from regular        17
   friction in the phase-plane.                   18

      Return to <Data>, <Enter parameters>. Enter 06
   a small number, say 0.1, for the friction par- 07
   ameter. Now follow the motion as before. See   08
   if you can guess in advance which of the two   09
   stationary magnets will finally hold the swing-10
   ing magnet. in <Time plots> select  time in-   11
   terval large enough for the motion to followed 12
   until one of the stationary magnets holds the  13

                                                  15
      In the cases just run the system had four   16
   equilibria, two stable (pointing, approxim-    17

   (vertical, up or down). This can be demon-     19
   strated in the utility <Data>, <See equilib-   20

                                                  05
      You can now use sliders to experiment with  06
   different values of the parameters, looking    07
   for values that can lead to more interesting   08
   motion. For instance, change H to be -1, so    09
   that the point of suspension of the pendulum   10
   is below the fixed magnets. You have 3 stable  11
   and 3 unstable equilibria. Have a look at the  12
   resulting motion.                              13
                                                  14
      Now experiment with changing the strengths  15
   and polarities of the fixed magnets, (C1 and   16
   C2) as well as their displacements from the    17

                                                  02
      The menu item <Run>, <Parameters> will ap-  03
   pear at the start of the program. You can      04
   specify dimensions of the swing and the child, 05
   the mass of the child and a parameter for the  06
   frictional resistance. (The resisting accel-   07
   eration is proportional to this parameter div- 08
   ided by the mass.) You can also specify how to 09
   control the animation: let the program (or the 10
   child) decide, or do it yourself, with a hot-  11
   key.                                           12
                                                  13
      For a start, accept default values, and let 14
   the motion be controlled automatically. Also   15
   accept the default starting conditions (i.e.,  16
   give the kid a push, at the lowest point) and  17
   watch the animation.                           18
                                                  19
      You may find it helpful to select <Phase-   20

      Next, if you have followed the technique    03
   of the child, select <Parameters> and manual   04
   control. Any good?                             05
                                                  06
      With the default values of the parameters   07
   the motion has increasing amplitude until      08
   circulation starts. If the friction is in-     09
   creased (or the mass decreased) you should     10
   be able to establish limit cycles. Look for    11
   values of the parameters that will achieve     12
   this.                                          13

                                                  02
      The satellite moves in an elliptic orbit    03
   in accordance with Kepler's laws. For a start, 04
   I suggest that you follow the demonstration    05
   in <Help>, <Elliptic orbit demo> from the      06
   menu. Become familiar with the way the eccen-  07
   tricity affects the shape of the orbit and the 08
   kinematics.                                    09
                                                  10
      The principal input screen will appear aut- 11
   omatically at the start of the program. It can 12
   be accessed through <Run>, <Enter parameters>. 13
   The default eccentricity is 0; leave it. The   14
   motion will start at pericenter. For initial   15
   conditions you can enter the initial angular   16
   deflection of the line of masses from the      17
   major axis (Theta) and the rate of change of   18
   this angle (ThetaDot). The period of the ellip-19
   tic orbit is 2*Pi units of time; so if you en- 20
   ter 360/2*Pi = 57.29578 for ThetaDot, the in-  21
   itial rotation rate of the pendulum will be    22
   equal to the average angular orbital rate.     23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      Accept all intial default values. You will  03
   then automatically see the animated motion of  04
   the satellite.                                 05
                                                  06
      The satellite is a 'pendulum' in orbit; the 07
   lowest point of the pendulum being equivalent  08
   to the line of masses pointing to the center   09
   of the Earth. The angle the line makes with    10
   this direction is called Phi in the program.   11
   Select <Run>, <Enter parameters>. Enter 40     12
   degrees for the initial displacement, and look 13
   at the animation. The pendulum analogy may be  14
   clearer.                                       15
                                                  16
      Phi and its derivative, PhiDot, are the co- 17
   ordinates in the phase-plane. Select <Phase-   18
   Plane>. Press <Input> to enter starting cond-  19
   itions. Use the mouse. Click on a position     20
   close to the center and see the plot in the    21
   phase-plane and the animated oscillations. Now 22
   pick starting points further away, until you   23
                                                  24

   observe circulation. The parallel with the     03
   simple pendulum should be clear.               04
                                                  05
      Select <Run>, <Enter parameters>. Enter     06
   0.1 for the eccentricity and 0 for the initial 07
   deflection. The animated motion is more inter- 08
   esting; but on average, the pendulum seems to  09
   be pointing toward the Earth. Next change the  10
   initial deflection to 40. Observe the motion.  11
   Now change it to 50; the motion has now become 12
   chaotic.                                       13
                                                  14
      Let's follow this in the phase-plane. This  15
   time, use the keyboard to enter starting cond- 16
   itions. Enter (40, 0) for the the initial      17
   (Phi, PhiDot). (PhiDot = 0 is equivalent to    18
   ThetaDot = 360/2*Pi.) The plot is tangled and  19
   hard to interpret. Look also at motion with    20
   starting conditions (0, 150) and (50, 0).      21
   Interpretation becomes simpler if Poincare     22
   maps are followed.                             23
                                                  24

      Select <Poincare map>. Choose to see the    03
   animation. Use the keyboard for starting cond- 04
   itions. Make three runs with conditions        05
   (40, 0), (0, 150) and (50, 0). Follow each run 06
   until you see a pattern forming. The program   07
   is following the calculation for the phase-    08
   plane plot, but only plots points at times     09
   0, 2*Pi, 4*Pi, 6*Pi,..., when the satellite    10
   completes an orbital revolution.               11
                                                  12
      Press <CleanUp>. This time, choose not to   13
   see the animation. Repeat the runs. You will   14
   see better plots, more quickly.                15
                                                  16
     Now try runs successively with conditions    17
   (0, 140), (0, 139), (0, 138), (0, 137). Having 18
   seen the figures, press <CleanUp> and choose   19
   to see the animation. Repeat the last run,     20
   noting what is taking place in the animation.  21
   The satellite completes two rotations of Phi   22
   for every orbital revolution.                  23

      Select <Plot Phi vs time>. Change the range 03
   of time to the plot to 50. Keep the starting   04
   conditions (0, 137). Go to the following input 05
   screen. Interpretation becomes harder! In in-  06
   ertial space, the satellite rotates three      07
   times for every single revolution. Then the    08
   angle (V - 3*Theta) will oscillate. Enter the  09
   numbers 1 and 3. Now see the plot.             10
                                                  11
      This is an introduction to the utilities.   12
   If you increase the eccentricity the chaos     13
   will become more pronounced. Two parameters    14
   have been ignored. You can include a coeffic-  15
   ient for a resisting term. This might apply    16
   to a satellite with a de-spinning torque.      17
                                                  18
      The equations for the model can be modified 19
   to apply to a non-spherical satellite if the   20
   term for the acceleration of Theta is mult-    21
   iplied by a factor less than one. See the      22
   second input screen for further details.       23

                                                  10
      You will see a graphics screen, with coord- 11
   inates x and y and an equilibrium position     12
   at the point (1,1). There are six sliders      13
   that enable you to change the values of the    14
   parameters. Experiment with these, making      15
   small changes, with interpretation, and see    16
   the effects on the equilibrium. Then press     17
   <Input>, choose the mouse, and click on a      18
   starting point. As the solution procedes, you  19
   can change the parameters. Try to keep the     20
   equilibrium on the screen. If it disappears,   21
   one man will cease to work, becoming a par-    22

Yoyo
        The Motion of a Yoyo: Walk-through        01
                                                  02
      The main input screen will appear at the    03
   start of the program. This can also be ac-     04
   cessed by selecting <Run>, <Enter parameters>  05
   from the menu. Become familiar with the in-    06
   terpretation of these parameters, in the de-   07
   sign of the yoyo. Accept the default values.   08
   Then accept the starting speed. Watch the      09
   animation. This can be repeated by pressing    10
   <Yoyo>.                                        11
                                                  12
      You can change the parameters and the       13
   starting speed by pressing hotkeys. The object 14
   is to maximize the angular velocity at the     15
   lowest point. Work principally on the outer    16
   radius of the central sprindle (around which   17
   the string is wound), the radius of the yoyo   18
   and its moment of inertia.                     19

    The Action Between a Violin Bow and String:   01
                    Walk-through                  02
                                                  03
      The input screen for parameters and initial 04
   conditions appears at the start. This can also 05
   be accessed by selecting <Action>, <Enter Par- 06
   ameters> from the menu. Accept the default     07
   values. In the graphics screen press <Start>   08
   and watch the animation. If you want to change 09
   the length of time for the action, press <Re-  10
   scale>.                                        11
                                                  12
      Now increase the friction by raising the    13
   value of A; this is the maximum frictional     14
   force when there is no relative velocity be-   15
   tween the surfaces. (B is the maximum when     16
   this velocity is nonzero.) Follow the effects. 17
   Then investigate the effects of changing B.    18
                                                  19
      Next experiment with changes in the speed.  20
   Finally, make adjustments to the spring        21
   constant.                                      22
                                                  23

                                                  03
      Select <Help>, <Run demonstration> from the 04
   menu. You will learn about the different types 05
   of motion that are possible.                   06
                                                  07
      Next select <Run>, <Enter parameters>. Look 08
   through the list; each one can be varied in    09
   experiments. Accept the default values. Then   10
   in the graphics screen press <Land>.           11
                                                  12
      The different types of motion are shown.    13
   The animation is not true since the numerical  14
   calculations are greater for some phases. The  15
   aircraft should land safely.                   16
                                                  17
      Press <Input> and change the landing speed. 18
   See if you can just land the aricraft on the   19
   edge of the deck!                              20
                                                  21
      Now return to the input screen and experi-  22
   ment. Change one parameter at a time.          23
                                                  24

     Pitching and Rolling at Sea: Walk-through    01
                                                  02
      Start by selecting <Help>, <About the       03
   model> from the menu. Become familiar with     04
   the parameters. Then select <Run>, <Enter      05
   parameters>. Look at the numerical values;     06
   accept the default values.                     07
                                                  08
      Select <Animate>. Notice the initial def-   09
   lections marked on the sliders. (The initial   10
   rates of change are zero.) Press <Run>.        11
   Although there is no initial rolling, notice   12
   the way that rolling starts.                   13
                                                  14
      Another way to see the motion is to plot    15
   the angles as functions of the time. Select    16
   <Time plots>. The default angles should be     17
   those just used; make sure that the angular    18
   rates are zero.                                19
                                                  20
      See how great you can make the initial      21
   values of pitching and rolling without dis-    22
   aster.                                         23

     Pitching and Rolling at Sea: Walk-through    01
                                                  02
      Parameters of importance are the natural    03
   frequencies of pitching and rolling, and the   04
   frequency of the sea. The default values are,  05
   approximately, 1, 0.5 and 0.5; so there are    06
   possible resonances between them, leading to   07
   large transfers of energy between the the      08
   modes of oscillation. See what happens if      09
   you use numbers such as 1, 0.7, 0.6.           10
                                                  11
      There are two parameters that control the   12
   coupling between pitching and rolling. Ex-     13
   periment with increasing these.                14
                                                  15
      Also experiment with the resisting terms.   16
   Suppose that the ship's stabilizers fail, so   17
   that these become zero. Increase the forcing   18
   amplitudes, so that the sea becomes rougher.   19

   Motion of a Ball in a Rotating Circular Ring:  01
                   Walk-through                   02
                                                  03
      The menu item <Run>, <Enter parameters>     04
   enables you to enter values for the angular    05
   rate of the spinning hoop and a parameter for  06
   the friction between the ball and the hoop.    07
   This must be used before selecting <See phase- 08
   plane>. If you select <Animate>, then these    09
   two parameters, together with the initial      10
   conditions for the ball, can be controlled     11
   using sliders.                                 12
                                                  13
      Select <Animate>. Start with default        14
   values. Then increase the initial displace-    15
   ment of the ball. You will observe pendulum-   16
   like motion.                                   17
                                                  18
      Increase the rotation rate of the hoop.     19
   When it is large enough, the lowest point of   20
   the ball will become unstable, and two points  21
   of stability will appear to the sides. This    22
   is and example of 'bifurcation.'               23
                                                  24

                                                  03
      Repeat this experiment introducing nonzero  04
   values for k, the friction coefficient.        05
                                                  06
      Choose values of the spin rate for which    07
   the lowest point of the ball is stable, and    08
   set the friction coefficient equal to zero.    09
   Then select <See phase-plane>. Build the       10
   phase-plane plot, showing different types of   11
   motion.                                        12
                                                  13
      Now increase the spin rate until the  bi-   14
   furcation occurs.                              15
                                                  16

      The main input screen will appear at the    03
   start of the program. This can also be ac-     04
   cessed by selecting <Run>, <Enter parameters>  05
   from the menu. Accept the default values.      06
   Then select <Animate the machine>, and follow  07
   animated motion. When you get tired of that,   08
   select <Plot path of pendulum> to see the pat- 09
   tern made by the end of the swinging pendulum. 10
                                                  11
      Repeat with more adventurous initial cond-  12
   itions; try an initial displacement of 90 deg. 13
                                                  14
      Now select <See Poincare maps>. To start,   15
   choose to see the animation along with the     16
   plotting of the maps. Follow the prompts, and  17
   choose a sufficient variety of starting cond-  18
   itions to establish the patterns of the maps.  19
   Any time you become impatient with the slow    20
   progress, due to the animation, press <Clean-  21
   Up> and choose not to see the animation.       22

                                                  02
      If you see some interesting map and would   03
   like to see the animation, then select <Ani-   04
   mate the machine>. The starting conditions     05
   will be the continuation of the motion that    06
   you were following.                            07
                                                  08
      The default value of 3 for the ratio of the 09
   masses leads to non-chaotic motion. Try 1.1.   10
   When you play with Poincare maps, you will see 11
   some organization in the central part of the   12
   screen and some toward the edge of the para-   13
   bolic region where the mapping takes place.    14
   You will also find that there are conditions   15
   leading to the length of the swinging pend-    16
   ulum becoming zero. When this happens, the     17
   calculation stops.                             18
                                                  19
      Change the mass ratio by small amounts, to  20
   see how this affects the non-chaotic and cha-  21
   otic behavior.                                 22

                                                  02
      This program has many similarities to that  03
   of the Forced Pendulum.                        04
                                                  05
      Start by selecting <Run>, <Enter param-     06
   eters> from the menu. Look at them and note    07
   their interpretations, but accept the default  08
   values. Similarly, select <Enter initial cond- 09
   itions>, and accept the default values. Then   10
   select <Animate>.                              11
                                                  12
      For the animation you can change the values 13
   of the parameters and initial conditions, us-  14
   ing the hotkeys. But for now, stay with the    15
   default set.                                   16
                                                  17
      When you have tired of the animation, look  18
   at the time plots. Plotting Phi (the angle for 19
   the orientation of the forced wheel) will not  20
   be effective here, since Phi is increasing     21
   indefinitely. Have a look at a plot of         22
   sin(Phi). Select <Plot Sin(Phi) versus time>.  23
                                                  24
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    25

                                                  02
      Now select <Run>, <Plot Phi-prime versus    03
   time>. Using the default values for the scale, 04
   you will get a good idea of the nature of the  05
   motion.                                        06
                                                  07
      Next, select <PhasePlot>, <See phase-plane  08
   plot>. For the lower limit of Phi-prime enter  09
   0, and for the upper limit enter 1000. You may 10
   want to see the plot only after an initial     11
   period of transient motion. For the moment,    12
   enter 0 for the time delay. Next, press        13
   <Keyboard> to enter the starting conditions    14
   from the keyboard. Accept the default values.  15
   Enjoy the plot and the animation.              16
                                                  17
      If the plot becomes too messy, press        18
   <CleanUp> and choose the option to continue    19
   the present plot. The existing plot will be    20
   erased, and you can continue to plot where     21
   the motion left off.                           22
                                                  23
   Click the mouse or hit any key to continue.    24
                                                  25

                                                  02
      For another way to avoid the plot of the    03
   early transient motion press <Time delay>,     04
   enter 10 and then press <CleanUp>. This time,  05
   choose a new plot. Use the keyboard once more  06
   to enter the starting conditions. You will see 07
   the early animation, but not the phase-plane   08
   plot. If this becomes too boring, press a key  09
   to stop.                                       10
                                                  11
      The delay option is principally for use in  12
   plotting Poincare maps: i.e., sampling the     13
   phase-plane plot once in every period of the   14
   forcing term. Select <See Poincare map>. Use   15
   the same scale as before, and enter a delay    16
   parameter of 15. Use the keyboard to enter     17
   the default starting conditions. The points    18
   that appear, show the final transient motion   19
   that approaches the final periodic state.      20
   This final state is represented by a dot. The  21
   output on the screen will becme more concen-   22
   trated if the delay parameter is increased.    23
                                                  24

                                                  02
      Finally, look at a bifurcation diagram.     03
   Select <See bifurcation diagram> and examine   04
   the first input screen. The parameter that is  05
   changed on the horizontal axis is k/I, where   06
   k is the spring constant and I is the moment   07
   of inertial of the driven wheel. You are       08
   prompted to enter the extreme values and the   09
   number of sample values to be used. Few values 10
   will produce a faster plot, but with less      11
   detail.                                        12
                                                  13
      Values of Phi-prime are plotted on the      14
   vertical scale. For a sharper diagram, the     15
   initial, transient motion should be ignored.   16
   The first p periods of the forcing term will   17
   be ignored. After that, q points are plotted.  18
   Higher values of p and q may give better       19
   plots, but the plotting will take longer.      20
                                                  21
      Finally, you can enter the starting value   22
   of Phi. This will affect the diagram.          23
                                                  24
